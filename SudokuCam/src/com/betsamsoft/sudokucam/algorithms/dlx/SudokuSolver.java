/**
 * This class uses Knuth's dancing links algorithm to solve a sudoku. It can solve a sudoku grid of
 * any size. The comments that follow assume a standard 9x9 sudoku grid.
 * <p>
 * Each row of the matrix represents a move (i. e., the placement of a digit digit into a cell.
 * Each of the 9 digits can be placed into any of the 81 cells. This means that the starting matrix
 * for a standard sudoku contains 729 (9*81) rows.
 * <p>
 * The matrix columns enforce the various constraints on the moves. Each move must satisfy 4
 * constraints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Each cell can hold only one digit. This is enforced by the first 81 columns, one for each cell.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Each value can appear only once in each row. The next 81 columns are one for each value in each
 * row.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Each value can appear only once in each column. The next 81 columns are one for each value in
 * each column.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Each value can appear only once in each block. The next 81 columns are one for each value in each
 * block.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * For a standard sudoku, the matrix will have a total of 324 (81*4) columns.
 * <p>
 * An "exact cover" will have (a) 1 value in each cell, (b) each value appearing exactly once in
 * each row, (c) each value appearing exactly once in each column, and (d) each value appearing
 * exactly once in each block.
